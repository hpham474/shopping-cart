# Shopping Cart

This project is a simple e-commerce web app built with React. It includes multiple pages: a homepage, various categorical pages, and a shop cart. Users can browse products, add them to a cart, and manage item quantities. The cart updates dynamically, showing the number of items added. Store items are fetched from FakeStore API. React Router is implemented to navigate between different pages. Testing was done using Vitest and React Testing library.
